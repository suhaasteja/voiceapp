# Plan

- Build a Next.js app with a single page for text input, voice selection, pitch, speed, preview, and MP3 download.
- Use the Web Speech API for instant preview (supports pitch/speed/voice in-browser).
- Use a serverless API route to generate high-quality MP3 via OpenAI TTS for download.
- Add deployment notes for Vercel and environment variables.
